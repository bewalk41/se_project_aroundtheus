# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

Around The U.S.

This project created by Bryan Walker based from Triple Ten is used to help beginner software engineers create a social media page for Jacques Cousteau. This site focus is a place where photos can be added, viewed, and liked based on the viewers taste.

The site also should be responsive and change based on viewers view dimensions, which helps this site be viewed on many different devices.
